# assignment-on-algorithms

This project implements algorithms in Python from scratch and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to select and run different algorithms.

## Objectives
- Implement algorithms without using built-in libraries that solve the task automatically.
- Write clean, efficient, and well-commented Python code.
- Use version control (GitHub) to track development.
- Include functional and performance testing.
- Provide a GUI so users can choose which algorithm to run.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyQt5 (for GUI)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the folder in your Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
3. Run the main Python file once created (e.g., `main.py`).

## Development Notes
Algorithms are implemented from scratch. Libraries may only be used for:
- GUI
- Reading/Writing files
- Displaying results

## Code of Conduct
This project follows a Code of Conduct to ensure respectful and professional collaboration. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
